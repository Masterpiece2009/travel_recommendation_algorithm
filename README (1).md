## 3. Recommendation Engine

The **Recommendation Engine** is the core component responsible for generating highly relevant, personalized travel suggestions. It combines multiple algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity.

### 3.1 Core Algorithms and Techniques

#### 3.1.1 Collaborative Filtering

**Concept:**  
Collaborative filtering leverages the idea that users with similar preferences or behaviors are likely to enjoy similar places. It depends on analyzing patterns of interactions such as likes, saves, views, and reviews across the user base.

**Implementation Details:**  
- **User-Item Interaction Matrix:** Represents user interactions with places; each cell indicates whether a user liked, viewed, or saved a place.
- **Similarity Computation:** Uses cosine similarity to measure how alike two users or items are, based on their interaction vectors:

\[
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B}}{\|\vec{A}\| \|\vec{B}\|}
\]

- **Nearest Neighbors:** Finds the top-K most similar users to a target user.
- **Recommendation:** Suggests places enjoyed by similar users that the target user hasn't interacted with.

**Example:**  
If User A liked Places X and Y, and User B liked Places X and Z, then the system might recommend Place Z to User A, and Places Y to User B.

#### 3.1.2 Content-Based Filtering

**Concept:**  
This method recommends places that match a user’s explicit preferences and profile attributes such as categories, tags, ratings, and budget considerations.

**Implementation Details:**  
- Each place is represented as a feature vector, including attributes like category, tags, average rating, and budget level.
- User preferences are similarly represented as a vector.
- Similarity between user preferences and place features is calculated using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.

**Workflow:**  
1. Vectorize user preferences.
2. Compute similarity scores with place feature vectors.
3. Rank places based on similarity, recommending the most aligned options.

**Example:**  
A user interested in "historical sites" with a "low budget" will be recommended museums, heritage towns, or ancient landmarks fitting these criteria.

#### 3.1.3 Semantic Search

**Concept:**  
Semantic search enhances recommendations by understanding the intent and context behind user queries, beyond simple keyword matching.

**Implementation Details:**  
- Embeds both user queries and place descriptions/tags into dense vector representations using NLP models such as spaCy or BERT.
- Measures semantic similarity between the query vector and place vectors.
- Retrieves places that are conceptually aligned with the user’s intent, even if exact keywords differ.

**Workflow:**  
1. Preprocess input query (tokenization, stopword removal).
2. Convert query and place descriptions into dense vectors.
3. Calculate cosine similarity.
4. Return places with the highest semantic relevance.

**Example:**  
A user searches for "family-friendly beaches." The system finds places tagged with "beach," "family," and "kids," even if those exact words don't appear in descriptions.

### 3.2 Core Functions & Their Roles

| Function Name | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Detailed Description |
|----------------|---------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| `get_candidate_places()` | Retrieves a pool of places matching user preferences | User preferences, user ID, desired result size | List of candidate places | Filters places based on categories, tags, location, and scores them using preference alignment metrics. |
| `find_similar_users()` | Identifies users with similar interaction profiles | User ID, minimum similarity threshold, maximum number of similar users | List of similar users with similarity scores | Uses cosine similarity over interaction vectors to find users with comparable tastes. |
| `get_collaborative_recommendations()` | Generates suggestions based on similar users' preferences | User ID, target number of recommendations, list of excluded place IDs | List of recommended place IDs | Aggregates popular places among similar users, filtering out already interacted places. |
| `rank_places()` | Scores and ranks candidate places | List of candidate places, user ID | Sorted list of places | Combines popularity, interaction data, similarity scores, and preferences to assign relevance scores, normalizing for ranking. |
| `generate_final_recommendations()` | Produces a curated list of suggestions by merging multiple algorithms | User ID, number of recommendations | Final list of recommended places | Integrates content-based, collaborative, and semantic scores for a balanced, personalized output. |

### 3.3 Recommendation Workflow

1. **Input Collection:** User ID and explicit/implicit preferences.
2. **Candidate Filtering:** Use `get_candidate_places()` to narrow down options based on basic preferences.
3. **Similarity Analysis:**  
   - Find similar users via `find_similar_users()`.

## 4. Roadmap Generation

The **Roadmap Generation Module** constructs customized travel itineraries, ensuring they are practical, enjoyable, and aligned with user preferences and constraints.

### 4.1 Key Features

- **Preference Integration:** Incorporates user-specified budgets, accessibility needs, and destination choices.
- **Scoring & Filtering:** Evaluates places based on multiple criteria, including budget compatibility and accessibility.
- **Route Optimization:** Connects selected destinations efficiently, minimizing travel time and distance.

### 4.2 Core Functions & Their Responsibilities

| Function Name | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|----------------|---------|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| `generate_hybrid_roadmap()` | Creates a personalized travel itinerary | User ID | Roadmap with ordered places and routes | Combines filtering, scoring, and route planning to produce a cohesive plan. |
| `check_accessibility_compatibility()` | Validates if places meet accessibility needs | Place details, user accessibility needs | Boolean | Checks if a place’s features satisfy the user’s accessibility requirements. |
| `calculate_budget_compatibility()` | Quantifies how well a place fits the user’s budget | Place’s budget level, user’s budget level | Score between 0 and 1 | Normalizes budget differences into a compatibility score. |
| `generate_routes()` | Connects selected places into an optimized route | List of places | List of routes with distances and sequence | Uses the Haversine formula to calculate distances and sequence destinations efficiently. |

### 4.3 Route Optimization & Distance Calculation

The system employs the **Haversine formula** to determine the great-circle distance between two points on Earth:

\[
d = 2r \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta \phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta \lambda}{2}\right)}\right)
\]

Where:  
- \(r \approx 6371\, \text{km}\) (Earth’s radius),  
- \(\phi\), \(\lambda\) are latitude and longitude in radians,  
- \(\Delta \phi\) and \(\Delta \lambda\) are differences in latitude and longitude.

This calculation informs route sequencing, ensuring minimal travel distances and efficient itinerary flow.

### 4.4 Dynamic Adaptability & Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Incorporate weather, traffic, and event data for live adjustments.
- **Group Itineraries:** Balance preferences among multiple travelers.
- **External Routing APIs:** Utilize third-party services for advanced route optimization and scheduling.
